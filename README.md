# Practice - AngularJS - Express - jsPDF
## About
This project is my test for the university, so here it is. We had to do a facturation system, it's simple, but it was so interesting :)  

I'm using AngularJS for the frontend, Express for the backend, Bootstrap and Materialize for the styles, FontAwesome for the icons and, finally, jsPDF for print the invoices.

## How to run this project
* Clone this repo and go to the path in your terminal (you'll need nodejs installed)
* Then, run `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies for the project.
* Finally, run `npm run dev` and open your browser in **localhost, port 3000**.
    * You can also run `nodemon server/main.js` or `node server/main.js` if you prefer.

## Some things to notice
Once you ran the project, created and printed an invoice, this will be saved at `static/facturas`, so keep this in mind.
